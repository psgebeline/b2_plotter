# `b2_plotter`

## Description
The `b2_plotter` package consists of the class Plotter(), whereby several plots based on numpy arrays and pandas dataframes can be created easily from interpretation of Belle II ROOT mDST files.

### Version 2.0.4
- Last push didnt include changes, so include bugfix

### Version 2.0.1
- Implement data plotting in plot()
- Implement unit tests for functions in non-interactive mode

### Version 1.0.9
- Set myrange = () in plotFom to enable the dynamic range calculation from v.1.0.5 if the user does not provide a range.

### Version 1.0.8
- Implement dynamic range calculation in plotStep 
- Bugfix labels not showing up on plotFom for myrange = () (default)
- Bugfix get_sigeff (missing period)

### Version 1.0.7

### Version 1.0.6
- Remove deprecated var total_bkg from plotFom()

### Version 1.0.5 
- Create example files for interactive session
- Change massvar name to be consistent (massVar in get_purity but massvar in FOM, etc)

### Version 1.0.4
- Bugfix main and implement a for loop to plot multiple variables
- Create usage details in README.md

### Version 1.0.3 
- Change readme such that recent versions are at the top 
- Remove `plotBias` function, as it is very niche
- Remove unused parameter `myrange` in get_sigeff and get_purity
- Add main() function 
- Add interactivity boolean in constructor call to decide whether or not to save plots to a .png or show them directly
